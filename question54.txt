Question:
what should i write in a motivational letter for an internship?

Answer:

A good motivation letter for an internship is not about telling your whole life story. It should clearly answer four questions:

Why this internship?

Why you?

What skills/experience do you bring?

What do you want to gain and contribute?

Below is a clear structure, followed by a strong example tailored for a scientific/technical internship (which fits your background).

1️⃣ Structure of a motivation letter
🔹 Paragraph 1 — Introduction & motivation

Who you are (degree, year, field)

Which internship you are applying for

Why you are interested in this opportunity

Keep it specific. Generic motivation = weak letter.

🔹 Paragraph 2 — Academic background

Relevant coursework

Research interests

Projects or university practice related to the internship

🔹 Paragraph 3 — Skills & experience

Technical skills (software, methods, lab experience)

Soft skills (problem-solving, teamwork, independence)

How these skills fit the internship tasks

🔹 Paragraph 4 — What you want to gain & contribute

What you expect to learn

How the internship fits your future plans

What value you can bring to the host institution

🔹 Paragraph 5 — Conclusion

Reaffirm interest
